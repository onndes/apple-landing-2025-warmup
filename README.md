# 🍎 Apple-style Header Practice (2025)

A non-commercial front-end practice project focused on building an **Apple-inspired expandable
header with a burger menu**, using modern tooling and native JavaScript.

This repository is part of a **personal skill restoration process** after a multi-year break from
professional front-end development.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal & Philosophy

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Restore **core front-end fundamentals**
- Rebuild confidence in **native JavaScript (DOM, events, state)**
- Practice **clean UI logic**, not just visual layout
- Avoid blind copying and instead focus on **understanding patterns**

> ⚠️ This is a **practice project**, not a production-ready application.  
> The code prioritizes **clarity, learning, and correctness** over premature optimization or complex
> abstractions.

## 🧠 What Is Practiced Here

- Apple-style **header expansion (push-down, not overlay)**
- Burger menu state management with **native JS**
- Scroll locking during menu open
- Closing logic:
  - click outside
  - `Esc` key
- Accessibility basics (`aria-expanded`)
- Separation of concerns between **CSS state** and **JS logic**

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The project uses a modern but minimal toolchain:

- ⚡ **Vite** — fast dev server and build tool
- 🧩 **HTML5** — semantic markup
- 🎨 **SCSS (Dart Sass)** — modular styles, nesting, variables
- 🧠 **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
  - DOM API
  - Event propagation
  - State via class toggling
- 📐 **BEM methodology** — predictable and maintainable class naming
- ♿ **Accessibility (A11y)** — basic ARIA practices
- 📱 **Responsive layout** — mobile-first approach
